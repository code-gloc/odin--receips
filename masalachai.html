<strong>ABOUT CHAI MASALA RECIPE</strong>
<p>Like the popular Garam Masala, every single family in India has their own unique blend of spices they prefer in their masala chai. But one thing is sure, this chai is definitely not like the chai latte you have at Starbucks or Peets. This is authentic Indian Masala Tea with Milk.</p>
<p>I am a complete chai person, and need my morning and afternoon cup of tea. My favorite is Masala Chai with a blend of whole spices and lots of ginger. It is a perfect way to kickstart the day right.</p>

<li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped</li>
