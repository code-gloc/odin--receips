<strong>ABOUT GULAB JAMUN RECIPE</strong>
<p>Gulab jamun is a milk-solid-based dessert from the Indian subcontinent that is popular in India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives (where it is called gulab ki janu), Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It is also officially designated as Pakistans national dessert by the Pakistani government.</p>
<p>It's also frequent in countries with large populations of people of South Asian descent. Instead of khoya, modern recipes substitute for dry or powdered milk. To improve the flavour, it is frequently garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews</p>
<strong>INGREDIENTS:-</strong>
<od> <li>2 cups water </li>
<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
<li>2 drops rose water</li>
<li>1 pinch saffron</li>
<li>½ cup instant dry milk powder</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>

<li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
<li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li></od>
<strong>DIRECTIONS:-</strong>
<em>step 1</em>
<p>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<em>step 2</em>
<p>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls.</p>
<em>step 3</em>
<p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer. Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</p>
<em>step 4</em>
<p>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</p>
<em>step 5</em>
<p>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
